## Storyline

SimCovid is a game that sets scene in the United States of America(USA), where you are the president of USA, and you must defend your citizens from the worst crisis in mankind - Covid. 

As president, you'll need to balance different aspects in the society, for example, economic and social. All actions you do, will have a cost.

Will you come out victorious, and set an example of "leadership", or defeated against the worst crisis in mankind history?
